This project is a collaborative effort by a team of four to build and program an Arduino-powered Lego car equipped with multiple sensors. The car is designed to perform autonomous tasks including automatic parking, lane following, obstacle avoidance, and maintaining safe distance from moving objects.

Features
Automatic Parking: The car can identify and park itself in designated spots.

Lane Following: Uses sensors to detect and follow lane markings.

Obstacle Avoidance: Detects and navigates around static obstacles.

Distance Maintenance: Keeps a safe distance from moving objects ahead.

Hardware Components
Arduino microcontroller

Infrared sensors

Lego car chassis and motors

10.000mAh for power supply

Software Details
Arduino IDE for programming

Sensor data processing for environment awareness

PID and state-machine based control logic for navigation and task execution


Getting Started
Assemble the Lego car chassis and attach sensors as per wiring diagram.

Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.

Power the system and test autonomous functions in a controlled environment.

Adjust sensor calibration and PID parameters for optimal performance.

Usage
Use the onboard sensors to start and control autonomous behaviors. Monitor the serial output for debugging and system feedback.
